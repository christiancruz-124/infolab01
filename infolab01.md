# What I hope to learn in INFO 201

I believe the applications of data are *endless*. I want to learn how to create
**useful** visualizations to better explain the world and it's problems.
## Some reasons why I feel I'll excel in INFO 201:
- I have a passion for solving problems
- I *love* design
- I've taken intro programming classes before
